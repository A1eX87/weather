**The code in this repo won't work beginning to end!**
Alright, so I majorly fucked up: I've been milking this analysis for over a year (read my whining here: https://taraskaduk.com/2019/02/18/weather/), and finally got tired of it and published what I had.
Right before that, I started refactoring the code... But since I'm a dumbass and an amateur, I only refactored half of it, and now it won't work as expected. For better or for worse, I broke out the code into 7 (SEVEN!) fucking scripts (each took a while to execute, so I created parts and checkpoints), so I was still able to run the final part of code that generates charts. But the other scripts may or may not work.

Since I really want to re-do this analysis in a different way anyway (7 scripts is an overkill), I didn't feel like fixng this mess.

But now this GH repo has been mentioned in the Revolutions Analytics blog (https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2019/03/best-and-worst-weather.html), and so I'm expecting some traffic to this repo...

## So, to all the visitors: don't use this shit! LOL. I'll write better stuff, just give me time.
